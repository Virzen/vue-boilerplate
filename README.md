## What is it?

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli                      # Install vue-cli if you haven't already
$ vue init Virzen/vue-boilerplate my-project  # Create a new project based on this template
$ cd my-project                               # Navigate into your new project folder

$ npm install -g live-server                  # Install live-server if you haven't already
$ live-server                                 # Run live-server and open it in your browser
```
